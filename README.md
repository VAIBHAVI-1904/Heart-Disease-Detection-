# ❤ Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on health parameters using machine learning.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can help in effective treatment. In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict heart disease using health-related features.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
- Features include:
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
  - Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG results
  - Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina
  - ST depression, Thalassemia, etc.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)

## 📈 ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy, Confusion Matrix used for evaluation
